title: Markdown on Visual Studio 2013

Today I got a nice surprise. I was updating a class on one of my OSS projects and I opened the README.md file to write the version history.
I had just changed the README to README.md to take advantage of the Markdown styling.

This was my surprise:

Markdown rendering inside Visual Studio.
Why was I editing markdown all this time on Notepad++? Why!?!?!?!

At first I thought this was a VS feature. Nop, It isn't.
This feature is from [Web Essentials plugin](http://vswebessentials.com/).

Anyway, this little surprise just made my day. (That and a new issue posted by someone with interest in the ar-SA locale on my library. This only shows it's beeing used by someone. I really love when new Issues arrive.).
