## If True Else....
This was an old project where I has asked to contribute.
It was a mixed of c# and vb.net. The most suprisingly piece of code I saw was this:

You might wander why... I know I do. The reason behind it was simple. Far far away there was a variable named `wathever`. Some day, after a change request, it was removed, so instead on refactoring code, ctrl.F - Replace `wathever` to `True` - Replace All....

What do you get? a bunch of lines of rubish...
