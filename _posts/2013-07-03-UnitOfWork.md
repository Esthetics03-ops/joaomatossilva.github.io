title: Unit Of Work
---

This time I want to indroduce my approach on the Unit Of Work pattern ([Unit of Work](http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/unitOfWork.html)).
If you're reading this and thinking EF or Nhibernate, then don't waste your time. DbContext and ISession are already implementations on Unit of Works.

I use my aproach mostly with Micro ORM frameworks, like Dapper, Simple.Data, etc...
Are you still using Ado.Net directly? In what year do you live in?
